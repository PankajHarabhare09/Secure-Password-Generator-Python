# 🔐 Advanced Password Generator (Python)

A secure and customizable password generator built using Python.  
This project allows users to generate strong passwords based on selected criteria and evaluate their strength.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate secure passwords using cryptographically strong methods
- Customizable password length (8–128 characters)
- Select character types:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters
- Password strength analysis system
- Save generated passwords with timestamp
- Input validation using exception handling
- Modular and clean code structure

---

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

This project uses Python’s `secrets` module instead of `random` to ensure cryptographically secure password generation.

Strength is calculated based on:
- Password length
- Character diversity
- Security scoring algorithm

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Functions & Modular Programming
- Exception Handling (try-except)
- File Handling
- Cryptographically Secure Random Generation
- Input Validation
- Clean Code Architecture
